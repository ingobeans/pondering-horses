![html](./images/gothtml.png)
![css](./images/css.gif)

made with raw html and css.

## new stuff:
- minewsweeper!!!
- a windows98 inspired project page
- the pond.
- microblog
- froggy

(and moreee!!!!!)

javascript is used for the background, minesweeper, draggable windows on the project page, and froggy, but is not necessary to have enabled. 

a python script, build.py, is used to generate parts of the page. my itch.io page is scraped to list all the games ive made on the projects page, and it also does things like substituting emojis and links.
